## Local development

This is a static site (no build step). Open any `.html` file directly or run a static server to test PWA features.

- Quick start:
  - Open `index.html` in your browser, or
  - `npx serve .` (or use any static server) and visit `http://localhost:3000` (port may vary)

- PWA/Service Worker:
  - Service worker requires HTTPS or `localhost`. For debugging, you can hard‑refresh or unregister the SW via DevTools (Application → Service workers → Unregister).
  - Live TV page intentionally does not re‑register the SW to avoid caching confusion during updates.

- API keys:
  - News APIs are configured in `js/news-api.js`. Keys are embedded for a demo experience; replace with your own API keys where needed.
  - OneSignal is initialized in `js/push-notifications.js` (update `appId` if you use a different project).

## Data sources (News)

Adapters in `js/news-api.js`:
- GNews
- NewsData.io
- NewsAPI.org
- Mediastack
- CurrentsAPI

Enhancements:
- Sports: specialized multi‑source strategy to increase volume and recency
- Kenya: enhanced Kenya‑relevant filters (keywords + domain heuristics), duplicates removed, newest‑first; page further filters to last 48 hours for freshness
- Technology/Health: boosted relevance and timeliness with dedicated adapters

## Category specifics

### Kenya
- Enhanced multi‑source fetching with expanded Kenya‑relevance detection (keywords + Kenyan domains + known sources)
- Deduped, newest‑first sorting; page filters to last 48h to keep content fresh

### Live TV (`live-tv.html`)
- 30 curated channels in `assets/js/live-channels.js` (YouTube + FAST: Pluto, Tubi, Plex, Red Bull, Fubo)
- Grid of channel cards with icons and Watch button
- Sticky inline player (top on desktop, bottom on mobile), ESC/× closes
- Filters (All/News/Sports/Entertainment/Science), search, and favorites (localStorage)
- Autoplay for YouTube; sandbox for FAST providers; graceful message if a provider blocks embeds
- Dark mode by default; fully themeable via the global theme system

To add or edit channels:
- Update `assets/js/live-channels.js` (id, name, icon, embed, category)

### Aviation (`aviation.html`)
- Live flight tracker using AviationStack + OpenSky (fastest source wins)
- Airline names inferred from flight numbers if missing; fewer “Unknown” labels
- Sorting (departure/arrival time, airline), UTC/Local time toggle, favorites (pin), copy info
- Auto refresh with countdown, search and status filter

### Weather
- Dedicated `weather.html` with a richer layout and styling

### Food & Recipes
- Pulls recipes with lazy image loading and resilient fallbacks

## Theming

- Themes are defined in `css/themes.css` and applied via `js/themes.js`
- Open the theme modal from the header palette icon
- Selected theme persists in localStorage and is applied across pages

## Accessibility

- Keyboard support for overlays (ESC to close), Enter/Space to activate, and consistent focus states
- Aria labels and live regions for player status updates

## Caching & service worker

- `service-worker.js` caches core pages and assets. Cache name bump forces eviction of stale content when updated.
- For debugging caching issues: hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) or temporarily unregister the service worker in DevTools.

## Deployment

- The repo is configured for GitHub Pages
- Commit to `main`; Pages will serve `main` branch content
- SW updates may require a hard refresh for clients

## Troubleshooting

- “Live TV shows old layout or empty grid” → Hard refresh and/or unregister SW. Ensure `assets/js/live-channels.js` is loading; the page retries once if not ready.
- “Kenya shows few items” → APIs may be rate‑limited. The page filters to last 48h by design; volume increases automatically as sources publish new items.
- “Aviation shows Unknown airline” → With OpenSky, some records lack names; we infer by IATA code when possible, otherwise show a neutral label.

## Contributing

- Fork and open a PR on `main`
- Keep pages static and CDN‑friendly (no build step)
- Match code style: clear names, early returns, minimal nesting, and accessible UIs

## Security

- Never commit private API keys to the repo. If you rotate keys, update `js/news-api.js` and re‑deploy.
